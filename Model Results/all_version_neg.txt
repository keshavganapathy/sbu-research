Some studies show that modulation of AMPK by leptin , alpha-lipoic acid or ghrelin is associated with decreased ( leptin and alpha-lipoic acid ) or increased ( ghrelin ) phosphorylation of its downstream target ACC , leading to stimulation or inhibition of ACC activity ( XREF_FIG ) . For example , leptin and metformin stimulate AMPK activity in skeletal muscle but inhibit it in the hypothalamus , whereas ghrelin and cannabinoids stimulate AMPK in the hypothalamus but inhibit it in liver and adipose tissue . Leptin has a tissue specific effect on AMPK : in the skeletal muscle , it stimulates AMPK activity whereas , in the hypothalamus , it has the opposite effect , decreasing hypothalamic AMPK activity . These apparently paradoxical tissue specific effects of leptin contribute both to the overall positive effect of leptin on energy homeostasis , leading to increased fatty acid oxidation in peripheral tissue and to reduced appetite in the hypothalamus with consequent reduction of body weight .

The results of transgenic overexpression of GLUT4 in muscle suggest that this change would be sufficient to explain the improved glucose disposal observed here , and indeed both basal and insulin stimulated glucose disposal and GLUT4 protein were elevated in an analogous in vivo model of deficient myostatin action , the myostatin null mouse , while muscle glycogen content was also increased by treatment with an ActRIIB inhibitor . However , activation of the PI3K and Akt pathway also plays an important role in insulin stimulated glucose disposal in skeletal muscle , and this is defective in muscle IR . Thus , it is as yet unclear whether myostatin 's beneficial effects on metabolism are due purely to an increase in muscle mass that increases the capacity for insulin stimulated glucose disposal , through an effect on muscle metabolism that is additional to this , or indeed whether the main beneficial effects are exerted primarily in other tissues . These data are consistent with increased capacity for basal and especially insulin stimulated glucose uptake into propeptide overexpressing muscles , which likely mediates the observed effect on glucose disposal . In this study we overexpressed ProMyo in a single muscle group to establish whether this would be sufficient to enhance insulin stimulated glucose disposal in a tissue-autonomous fashion and whether any increase would be proportional to the enhanced muscle mass , or be the result of an additional effect of myostatin inhibition on muscle signaling or metabolism . Translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane from its intracellular depot is required for insulin stimulated glucose uptake by muscle cells , involving inhibition of the GTPase activity of the Rab-GTPase-activating protein Akt substrate of 160 kDa ( AS160 and TBC1D4 ) , whereas GSK3beta mediated disinhibition of glycogen synthase is necessary for glycogen synthesis . The increased glucose disposal was associated with increased GLUT1 and GLUT4 glucose transporter content , implying an increased capacity for both basal and insulin stimulated glucose uptake ( the latter being of more relevance during the IPGTT , when total levels of plasma membrane GLUT4 would be much higher than those of GLUT1 ) .

We find that IFN-gamma potently stimulates activation of the primary autophagy effector , LC3 . To further explore the mechanism for IFN-gamma mediated autophagy , we examined a published gene array analysis of keratinocytes treated with IFN-gamma to determine genes that were both highly induced by IFN-gamma and involved in autophagy . However , the role of IFN-gamma induced autophagy in protection of keratinocytes from bacterial pathogens is not known . To our knowledge , this is the first evidence that autophagy and ApoL1 induced by IFN-gamma play an essential role in resistance to staphylococcal alpha toxin in human keratinocytes . To determine whether IFN-gamma induces autophagy in keratinocytes , we assessed LC3 activation . We screened a previously published array analysis of IFN-gamma treated keratinocytes for genes related to autophagy , and found that IFN-gamma significantly induced the autophagy effector , ApoL1 .

Nuclear ERKs induce cell cycle entry in an Rb- and lamin A dependent fashion . Furthermore , we show that cells deficient for Rb are refractory to the increments on E2F mediated transcription and on cell cycle progression induced by nuclear ERKs , in full consonance with previous experiments . In support of this notion , we show that ( a ) lamin A 's inhibitory effect on ERK induced cell cycle transit is lost in Rb -/- cells and ( b ) cells devoid of lamin A are insensitive to the stimulatory effects of ERKs on cell cycle entry . ERK1/2 MAP kinases promote cell cycle entry by rapid , kinase independent disruption of retinoblastoma-lamin A complexes . Importantly , cell cycle progression induced by ERKs was dependent on lamin A because its overexpression was sufficient to suppress the growth advantage conferred by ectopic nuclear ERK2 ( XREF_FIG , top and bottom ) . Herein , we describe a novel mechanism whereby ERKs directly stimulate cell cycle entry immediately after they penetrate in the nucleus .

IL-17 induces PMN influx through induction of G-CSF and chemokines ( see Section 3.4 ) , which contribute to the production of IFN-alpha by pDC via the NETosis process ( see Section 4.1.1 ) . Final support for a limited role of pDC in TB pathogenesis comes from the observation that pDC produce IFN-alpha after endosomal TLR activation , while it is shown that Mtb primarily induces IFN-beta through activation of cytoplasmic PRRs ( see Section 2.3 ) . As mentioned in Section 2.3 IFN-alpha is produced in an IRF7 dependent way by pDC and other myeloid cell types . First , besides being major inducers of IFN-alpha production by pDC upon NETosis , PMN also appear to be a significant source of IFN-alpha themselves .

This inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3beta is an early step in the ATRA induced differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells , in keeping with the importance of inhibition of activity of GSK-3beta to cell differentiation . Twenty-five years ago Knight and co-workers [ XREF_BIBR ] showed that ATRA mediated myeloid differentiation of HL-60 and RDFD2-25 myeloid leukemic cells was associated with a rapid decrease in IMPDH activity . ATRA can be used to drive differentiation of non APL myeloid leukemia cell lines , but this often requires a much higher concentration to obtain the same degree of differentiation as APL cell lines . Sartorelli 's group has shown that inhibitors of GSK-3 prevent ATRA mediated degradation of RARalpha , thereby potentiating ATRA stimulated differentiation of AML cell lines [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] . One of the reasons why non APL AML cells respond poorly to ATRA is that target genes that are important to the ATRA driven differentiation pathway are not properly activated as to their transcription . It is well known that activation of RARalpha drives the differentiation of normal myeloid progenitor cells and myeloid cell lines towards neutrophils , and examination of in vitro models of ATRA driven myeloid differentiation has identified genes that play important roles in this process , including transcription factors and regulators of survival versus apoptosis [ XREF_BIBR ] .

These mice were used to determine the physiological role of beta-cell PKA activity in potentiating glucose stimulated insulin secretion .

XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR These are smaller than the size of our m-HAP ; however , it is noteworthy that our observations showed that clathrin- and caveolin mediated endocytosis were also implicated in the internalization of m-HAP in HUVECs . XREF_BIBR According to previous studies , caveolin mediated endocytosis formed caveolaes have an average size of about 120 nm , and the average size of clathrin mediated endocytosis formed vesicles was about 150-200 nm . HANPs were mainly uptaken via clathrin- and caveolin mediated endocytosis , while macropinocytosis was the main pathway for m-HAP uptake . Compared to m-HAP , a large amount of HANPs adhered to the cell membrane and were subsequently uptaken by HUVECs mainly through clathrin- and caveolin mediated endocytosis .

These data differ from previous results -- where in contrast to naive T cells -- CD25 + CD4 + T reg cells produced little or no IFN-gamma after stimulation in vitro . Thus , IFN-gamma production by alloantigen-reactive T reg cells may influence the ability of effector T cells to initiate graft rejection . IFN-gamma production by T reg cells also may influence the expansion of GR1 + macrophages that can suppress the proliferation of naive T cells by a nitric oxide dependent mechanism . Although up-regulation of IFN-gamma mRNA production by CD25 + CD4 + alloantigen-reactive T reg cells was very rapid , transcription was not sustained ( XREF_FIG ) .

In addition , the role of BH 4 or BH 2 mediating eNOS coupling or uncoupling exclusively during the early reperfusion has not been assessed in real-time in vivo or ex vivo . To further promote additional eNOS uncoupling , it would be necessary to increase eNOS activity , such as with a protein kinase C ( PKC ) epsilon activator , combined with additional BH 2 . In summary , this study further supports the conception of BH 4 promoting eNOS coupling during I/R . Therefore , in the nonischemic aortic segments , we found that BH 4 dose dependently increased NO release by promoting eNOS coupling to produce more NO . This trend of decreasing NO bioavailability by BH 2 may be because BH 2 promotes eNOS uncoupling and facilitates eNOS to produce SO instead of NO , which further quenches NO via the formation of peroxynitrite [ XREF_BIBR ] . Conversely , supplementing BH 4 under increased eNOS activity conditions may promote additional eNOS coupling that otherwise would not be observed under constitutive eNOS activity conditions [ XREF_BIBR ] .

These results suggest that basal NHE3 activity is , at least partially , regulated by clathrin mediated endocytosis . Recently , studies using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) have characterized nine clathrin independent endocytosis pathways in addition to clathrin mediated endocytosis ( CME ) [ XREF_BIBR ] . Furthermore , basal NHE3 activity is lipid raft dependent in OK cells [ XREF_BIBR ] suggesting that an alternate pathway to clathrin mediated endocytosis may exist for NHE3 trafficking . Similar results were obtained in cells exposed to K + -depleted conditions , which also blocks clathrin mediated endocytosis by removing membrane associated clathrin lattices ( data not shown ) [ XREF_BIBR ] . Therefore , the current study was designed to test the hypotheses that ( 1 ) clathrin mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is involved in constitutive , but not CCH mediated , endocytosis of NHE3 , and ( 2 ) CCH mediated endocytosis of NHE3 occurs through a lipid raft , activated Cdc42 dependent pathway that does not involve clathrin . Our results show that basal , but not CCH inhibited , NHE3 activity involves clathrin mediated endocytosis based on studies using chlorpromazine and K + -depletion to prevent CME . It has been recently demonstrated that clathrin independent endocytosis requires lipid rafts while clathrin mediated endocytosis does not . This study tested the hypotheses that : ( 1 ) inhibition of clathrin mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , prevents basal but not CCH mediated , endocytosis of NHE3 , and ( 2 ) CCH mediated endocytosis of NHE3 occurs through a lipid raft and activated Cdc42 dependent pathway that does not involve clathrin .

The SE induced by pilocarpine is similar to SE induced by kainic acid and the site of initial EEG changes in the two models is different . SE induced by pilocarpine later leads to the development of spontaneous limbic seizures and MF sprouting in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus . This results in a significantly lower dose of pilocarpine ( 20-30 mg/kg ) needed to induce SE . All other features are similar to SE induced by high doses of pilocarpine . Pilocarpine induced SE causes massive neuronal damage when examined at 24 to 72 h. Studies have found cell death in olfactory cortex , the amygdaloid complex , thalamus , neocortex , hippocampus and substantia nigra [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] . The basal amygdala and ventral hippocampus are very sensitive to pilocarpine induced SE . This may explain the absence of wet dog shakes at the beginning of pilocarpine induced SE . Pilocarpine is generally used for systemic administration to induce SE in rats and mice . As in the KA model , the pilocarpine induced SE leads to the development of spontaneous limbic motor seizures and MF sprouting in the dentate gyrus [ XREF_BIBR ] . The SE induced by the chemoconvulsants kainic acid , pilocarpine , lithium-pilocarpine and diisopropylfluorophosphate are widely employed to characterize the pathophysiology and to evaluate therapeutic interventions . Briefly , rats are injected with two doses of pilocarpine ( 20 mg/kg , i.p. , per 30 min ) to induce persistent SE . Injections of large doses of pilocarpine induce EEG and behavioral limbic seizures and SE . It is thought that pilocarpine initiates SE by cholinergic hyperactivation , but that continuation of seizure activity is likely through a glutamatergic mechanism .

Specifically , although human IL-15 ( hIL-15 ) induces survival and proliferation of mouse NK cells , it is not clear whether the reverse is true .

We found that human NK cells cultured in vitro with hIL-15 proliferated extensively ( predominately the CD56 hi CD16 - subset ) ; this was in contrast to those cultured in mouse IL-15 ( mIL-15 ) , which itself sufficiently induced proliferation of mouse NK cells ( XREF_FIG and Fig .

The increase in TRIB3 induced by glucose and glucosamine was accompanied by reductions in basal and insulin stimulated glucose transport activity , as shown in XREF_FIG , consistent with the functional consequences that HBP metabolism exerts on the glucose transport effector system . The third aspect of the current data is that short hairpin RNA mediated suppression of TRIB3 in L6 myocytes blocked the ability of high glucose and glucosamine to diminish basal and insulin stimulated glucose transport rates by ~ 50 % compared with that observed in control cells . Our subsequent work demonstrated that TRIB3 protein levels were elevated in skeletal muscle from hyperglycemic rodent models and from T2DM patients in a manner that was correlated with fasting glucose , that TRIB3 levels were regulated by media glucose concentrations in L6 cells , and that overexpression of TRIB3 blocked insulin stimulated glucose transport rates .

These results provide additional evidence in support of the hypothesis that nitrative stress is involved in PQ mediated injury . The present study demonstrated that PQ significantly increases MDA production and activates SOD , which was consistent with a previous study This suggests that PQ simultaneously stimulates oxidative stress injury and anti-oxidative defenses to ameliorate lipid peroxidation . It was hypothesized that globular domain adiponectin ( gAd ) may protect against PQ induced lung injury by attenuating oxidative and nitrative stress . gAd reduced PQ induced pulmonary oxidative injury in a dose dependent manner . gAd pre-treatment markedly attenuated 3-NT production at 24 and 72 h , and decreased 8-OHdG after 72 h. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first evidence demonstrating that adiponectin protects against PQ mediated lung injury by attenuating peroxynitrite induced protein nitration and DNA damage via a reduction in nitrative stress . The current study showed that PQ significantly increased NO production , which emphasized the pathophysiological importance of NO in PQ mediated lung injury . Furthermore , gAd may be a potential therapeutic agent for PQ induced lung injury , and further pharmacological studies are therefore warranted . Previous experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that PQ directly contributes to lung injury by inducing inflammation , edema and fibrosis . This provides evidence that the adipocytokine , adiponectin , which is known to have antidiabetic , anti-atherogenic , antitumor and anti-inflammatory properties , also exerts a pulmonary protective effect against PQ induced injury . In conclusion , the present study demonstrates that gAd protects against PQ induced lung injury in a BALB/c mouse model , by attenuating oxidative and nitrative stress in a dose dependent manner . These results suggest that gAd protects against PQ induced lung injury by mitigating oxidative and nitrative stress . gAd reduced PQ induced pulmonary nitrative injury in a dose dependent manner . Compared with the control group ( XREF_FIG ) , PQ administration caused acute injury to pulmonary tissue , as demonstrated by the interstitial edema and inflammatory cell infiltration ( lymphocytes and histiocytes ) observed in the alveolar space and septum ( XREF_FIG ) . In addition , gAd protects against PQ induced lung injury by mitigating nitrative stress . Ultimately the aim would be to assess the potential of adiponectin as a novel therapeutic agent in PQ induced lung injury .

In the present study , we examined the molecular function of HATi II in glioma cell lines , and observed that HATi II can inhibit proliferation and induce cellular apoptosis via the caspase dependent apoptotic pathway . These results were consistent with the Annexin V assay and cell cycle analysis , and confirmed that HATi II induces apoptosis in U251 and SHG44 cells . HATi II inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis via the caspase dependent pathway in human glioma cell lines , possibly by activating the p53 signaling pathway . Therefore , these results indicate that lncRNAs may play a role in HATi II induced apoptosis in glioma cell lines . HATi II inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis via the caspase dependent pathway in glioma cell lines , possibly by activating the p53 signaling pathway . As we observed that HATi II induced apoptosis in glioma cells , we examined the cleavage of PARP , caspase-9 and caspase-3 by Western blotting . HATi II induces apoptosis in U251 and SHG44 cells . Cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP is indicative of apoptosis and confirmed that HATi II induced apoptosis via the caspase dependent pathway .
