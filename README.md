# SBU-NLPResearch
I was one of the 50 admitted into the Simons Summer Research Program, a prestigious 7-week research opportunity with an 8% acceptance rate and a $1,000 stipend. Due to COVID-19, the program is officially canceled; however, I am able to still work with my mentor, Dr. Niranjan Balasubramanian, virtually.The code done during the summer can be found in this repository.

Project Title: <i>Research on Generating explanations for relation extraction models.</i>

As a part of my research, I developed a mechanism detection model. However, these pytorch models are often too big. Please email me if you would like the model itslef. Email: kganapathy23@gmail.com.
